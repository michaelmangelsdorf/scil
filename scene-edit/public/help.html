<h2>Scene Editor Module</h2>
<p>The **Scene Editor** is where you build and manage the foundational narrative elements of your story. It allows you to create, organize, and define the context for each "scene," which are then used by other AI modules to maintain narrative consistency and generate relevant content.</p>

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>**Scene List**: Displays all created scenes. You can reorder scenes using drag-and-drop to define narrative flow.
        <ul>
            <li>**Include in Inference Checkbox**: Toggle whether a scene's Canon and Synopsis are included as context for AI inference in modules like "Basic Inference" and "Vector Expert".</li>
            <li>**Token Counts**: Shows estimated token counts for the dialogs within the scene and the scene's own Canon/Synopsis.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>**Scene Details**: Define the core attributes of each scene:
        <ul>
            <li>**Name**: A descriptive title for the scene.</li>
            <li>**After**: A brief note indicating what time period or event this scene occurs after (e.g., "1 hour," "next day," "after the battle").</li>
            <li>**Synopsis**: A concise summary of the main events that happen within the scene. This is a critical piece of information for AI context.</li>
            <li>**Canon**: Immutable truths or established facts specific to this scene (e.g., "The ancient ruins are guarded by a dragon.").</li>
            <li>**Save Scene**: Persists changes to the scene details.</li>
            <li>**Delete Scene**: Removes the scene and all its associated dialogs.</li>
            <li>**New Scene**: Clears the input fields to create a new scene.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>**Dialogs Section**: Manages the individual dialog entries within the selected scene.
        <ul>
            <li>**Dialog List**: Shows a list of dialogs. You can reorder them via drag-and-drop.</li>
            <li>**Dialog Details**: Edit individual dialog entries:
                <ul>
                    <li>**AI Persona**: The name of the AI agent who spoke the response.</li>
                    <li>**User Persona**: The name of the character who spoke the query.</li>
                    <li>**User Query**: The input provided by the user (or player).</li>
                    <li>**AI Response**: The response generated by the AI agent.</li>
                    <li>**Comment**: Optional notes about the dialog's quality or relevance.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>**Save Dialog, Delete Dialog, New Dialog**: Standard CRUD operations for dialogs.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>**Scene Closure**:
        <ul>
            <li>**Summarise this scene**: Use a selected 'Summarizer' agent to automatically generate an updated Synopsis for the current scene based on its Canon and all associated dialogs. This is useful for condensing long interactions into a manageable summary for future AI context. Choose an agent of type 'Summarizer'.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>**Clear Database Scenes**: A dangerous button that will delete ALL scenes and dialogs in the entire application. Use with extreme caution.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How it Works:</h3>
<p>Scenes are the building blocks of your narrative timeline. Each scene's Canon and Synopsis, along with its ordered dialogs, are crucial for providing contextual awareness to AI models in other applications. For instance, the "Basic Inference" module pulls a timeline of included scenes and their summaries to give conversational agents a long-term memory of past events. The ability to reorder scenes and dialogs ensures that the AI receives context in the correct narrative sequence. The "Summarise this scene" feature automates the process of condensing dialogs into a concise synopsis, maintaining a high-level narrative thread without overwhelming the AI with raw conversation data.</p>
